This HTML file serves as a structured, single-page reference guide for some of the most significant datasets currently available in the fields of Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics. By presenting the information in a clean, responsive HTML table, the file organizes essential details—such as dataset names, descriptions, key features, and direct access links—into an easily digestible format. The inclusion of internal CSS styling ensures that the document is not only functional but also visually professional, allowing users to immediately view and interact with the data in any web browser without needing external dependencies.

The primary purpose of this file is to streamline the initial research phase for data scientists, educators, and policy analysts who are seeking reliable data for their projects. Instead of searching through scattered repositories, users can utilize this document as a centralized dashboard to compare different datasets and identify the one that best fits their specific analytical needs, such as predicting student grades, analyzing MOOC engagement, or performing knowledge tracing. It effectively acts as a launchpad, connecting users directly to source repositories like UCI, Kaggle, and government databases, thereby accelerating the development of educational models and insights.
